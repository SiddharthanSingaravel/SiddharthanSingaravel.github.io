### Detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Student Writing
- End-to-end Machine Learning (MLOps) pipeline to detect compromising student information in their academic writings. Cron-scheduled CI/CD pipelines incorporated to auto evaluate and finetune for the incoming feature vectors. <br>
- Tools: DVC, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Tensorboard, Tensorflow, Airflow, MLFlow, HuggingFace (fetching pretrained models), Python <br>

### MetMuseum-based Artwork Synthesis using Latent Diffusion Models
- By synthesizing images that mimic the styles curated at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this study demonstrates the potential of deep learning technologies in bridging the gap
between art and artificial intelligence. <br>
- The efficacy of diffusion models, particularly under the influence of different noise schedules and iteration counts, highlights their robustness and versatility in generating complex image distributions. <br>
