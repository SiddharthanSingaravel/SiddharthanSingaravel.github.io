### Estimating Pi through Monte-Carlo Methods
- Developed a Monte Carlo simulation using random point sampling in a unit square to estimate Ï€. Generated 1M+ random (x,y) coordinates and calculated the ratio of points falling inside a quarter circle to total points, achieving a 3-digit precision estimate of Ï€ â‰ˆ 3.141.
- Implemented statistical convergence analysis using the Law of Large Numbers, demonstrating how increasing sample size improves estimation accuracy. Visualized convergence patterns through matplotlib animations, showing error reduction from 10% to <0.1% with increased iterations.

### Two Chords Intersecting: What are the chances?
- This Monte Carlo simulation explores the probability of two randomly drawn chords intersecting within a unit circle. The experiment generates random chords and determines whether they intersect, repeating this process 10,000 times to estimate the probability empirically.
- As the trials accumulate, we converge on an empirical probability, offering insight into this geometric phenomenon. This experiment not only demonstrates the power of Monte Carlo methods in solving complex probabilistic problems but also reveals the hidden patterns within seemingly random geometric configurations. <br>
