### Detecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in Student Writing
- End-to-end Machine Learning (MLOps) pipeline to detect compromising student information in their academic writings. Cron-scheduled CI/CD pipelines incorporated to auto evaluate and finetune for the incoming feature vectors. <br>
- Tools: DVC, Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, Tensorboard, Tensorflow, Airflow, MLFlow, HuggingFace (fetching pretrained models), Python <br>

### MetFaces: Latent Diffusion Image Synthesis
- Implemented and optimized a diffusion-based generative model using a modified U-Net architecture for art-styled facial image synthesis, leveraging the MetFaces dataset (1,336 images). Conducted comparative analysis of linear and cosine noise schedules, achieving a 15% improvement in Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores with the cosine schedule <br>
- Optimized diffusion-based generative model training for art-styled facial image synthesis using NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU with CUDA acceleration, achieving FID scores under 30. Implemented hyperparameter tuning with Hyperopt and experiment tracking via MLflow <br>
